When the same comment thread appears on multiple pages, this is normally due to multiple thread identifiers being assigned to the same thread whenever the thread was initially created.

Resolving identifier conflict
Identifier conflict can be resolved by verifying that a unique URL is being set and then assigning a unique identifier. This will create a new thread on pages which were previously displaying the same thread. Note that thread identifiers and URLs are set using our embed Javascript Variables.

You can also check if identifiers are being assigned to the same thread using our API console.

Prevention
To prevent this from happening, you'll need to ensure that both the identifier and thread are unique when creating new threads.
