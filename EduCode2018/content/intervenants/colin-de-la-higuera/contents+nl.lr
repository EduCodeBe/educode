SIF
----


**The [Société informatique de France
(SIF)](http://www.societe-informatique-de-france.fr/) is the French
Learned Society in Informatics (or Computer Science).**:

-   The SIF was created in May 2012, and I have been its president till
    February 2015.
-   The SIF works on the following definition of informatics:
    ["L'informatique : la science au cœur du numérique]().

### What does the SIF do?

-   The SIF is arguing in favour of teaching informatics at school. The
    SIF insists that a crucial issue is that the teachers are well
    formed is the French Learned Society in Informatics (or Computer
    Science).
-   The SIF is interested in research and has been active in promoting
    the [innovation
    issues](http://videolectures.net/sifinformatique2013_paris/).
-   [report on forming the
    teachers](http://www.societe-informatique-de-france.fr/actualite/2013/Rapport_SIF_sur_ISN.pdf).
-   [1024](http://1024.labri.fr/no1.html) is the new journal launched by
