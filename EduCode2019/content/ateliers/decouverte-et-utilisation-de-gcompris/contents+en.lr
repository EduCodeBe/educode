description:

GCompris is a rich educational software, including more than a
hundred activities aimed at children from 2 to 12 years old.

Those activities are playful, but always educational. The topics
include reading and typing, arithmetics, geography, sciences,
and other topics. This workshop will allow you to get familiar
with all the options available, that allow you to adapt the
software to different kinds of users.

We will then make a tour of the main activities to present their
content. Finally, we will talk about the work-in-progress features
made especially for teachers and schools, and give some hints
for people who want to get involved in the project.
